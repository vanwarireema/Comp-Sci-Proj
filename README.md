Recreation of the New York Times Wordle game with a twist
User has the option to two games, Wordle or Absurdle.


The Wordle game is coded to be the "hard" version of Worldle. 
When playing NYT's version, the user has the option to toggle 
on the difficult mode which means all hints revealed must be
used in consecutive guesses, otherwise the guess is considered
invalid.

ex. you guess "hello"
h,e are green o is yellow
your next guess MUST start
with "he" and have an "o"
in the guess or it will not
submit

Absurdle is very similar to wordle except
you are trying to not guess the given word
within the 6 tries, otherwise you lose the game. 

The rules are the same though, once you guess a
word with a correct letter, it must be used in the
consecutive guess otherwise it's not a valid guess.

you musthave six guesses in absurdle that don't
match the word in order to win.
